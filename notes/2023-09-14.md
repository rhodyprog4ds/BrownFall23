# DataFrames from other sources

Today we will:

- continue examining the dataframe object
- see more ways to load data
- make sure you are set up for assignment 2

## Indexing reivew


```{code-cell} ipython3
topics = ['what is data science', 'jupyter', 'conditional','functions', 'lists', 'dictionaries','pandas' ]
topics[-1]
```
negative numbers count from the right

## Reserve words
these are words you do not want to use for variable names

Python reserve words turn green:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
def
```

## Built in iterable types

These are four different iterable constructions: 
```{code-cell} ipython3
a = [char for char in 'abcde']
b =  {char:i for i, char in enumerate('abcde')}
c = ('a','b','c','d','e')
d = 'a b c d e'.split(' ')
```

We can see their types
```{code-cell} ipython3
type(a), type(b), type(c), type(d)
```

Dictionaries are really useful because they consist of key, value pairs.  This is really powerful and we will use it a lot to pass complex structures into functions. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
b
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a
```

Where we index lists with numbers
```{code-cell} ipython3
a[0]
```

we can access items, the values in a dictionary using square brackets and the keys
```{code-cell} ipython3
b['b']
```

## Building iterables quick with Comprehensions

- [list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) are **super** handy

we can make a list using a loop all in one line
The constructions above for `a` and `b` are called list and dictionary **comprehensions** it is equivalent to using a loop, but a more concise way to build a list with a loop. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
a_long = []
for char in 'abcde':
    a_long.append(char)
```
Notice that even in this for loop the lopo variable is a conceptually meaningful variable and we iterate over the items in an iterable type object.  This is incontrast to creatinga loop variable that is an integer.  This loop style is considered good pythonic strategy.  

For more detail, see the Python docs [section on looping strategies](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#looping-techniques)

```{code-cell} ipython3
a_long
```

```{hint}
> **Programming is a practice**
> the goal is not to memorize everything, but be exposed to enough that you remember what you can look up later
```

enumerate is a built in function that allows you to get both a number and an item for your use in a loop or comprehension.  You can read the help below or the [technical details in the official Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate)
```{code-cell} ipython3
help(enumerate)
```

## Read DataFrames from HTML


let's use `read_html` on the course communications page and then inspect what we get to figure it out
```{code-cell} ipython3
course_comms_url = 'https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall23/syllabus/communication.html'
```

we will first need out library

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

then we will read it in without saving it and look at the output to see what it looks like. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_html(course_comms_url)
```

now we will save it to a variable for future use. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
comm_df_list = pd.read_html(course_comms_url)
```

we can check the type, it is a list as we noted from looking at the outpu. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
type(comm_df_list)
```

and each item in the list is a DataFrame
```{code-cell} ipython3
type(comm_df_list[0])
```

DataFrames also have a `shape` attribute, to tell us  the number of rows and columns. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
comm_df_list[0].shape
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
achievements_url = 'https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall23/syllabus/achievements.html'
```

Make a list of the shapes of all of the tables on the [syllabus Achievements page](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall23/syllabus/achievements.html).

This is a good job for a list comprehension. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
shape_list_comp =[df.shape for df in pd.read_html(achievements_url)]
shape_list_comp
```

Again, we can write this out as a for loop with append, but the comprehension is more concise.
```{code-cell} ipython3
shape_list = []
for df in pd.read_html(achievements_url):
    shape_list.append(df.shape)
```

in the comprehension structure the `[]` are what make it a list, they make anything a list
```{code-cell} ipython3
type([1,2,3])
```

## More DataFrame Indexing

we'll go back to our coffee data

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/robusta_data_cleaned.csv'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df = pd.read_csv(coffee_data_url,index_col=0)
```

See again our shape
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.shape
```

and the first few rows

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.head(1)
```

we can also see a random sample, not only the head and tail

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.sample(3)
```

```{hint}
printing out the list of columns is a helpful way to get them to copy-paste for later selection to ensure no typos. In a polished notebook, you could then delete a cell like the one below, but it's really helpful while you are working
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.columns
```

We can subset columns by passing a list of multiple columns to use for indexing
```{code-cell} ipython3
columns_of_interest = ['Owner', 'Country.of.Origin']
coffee_df[columns_of_interest].head(1)
```

it has to be a list though, if we put them in one set of square brackets, it is a tuple and we get a `KeyError` because it looks for **one** column that has the name `'Owner', 'Country.of.Origin'`
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Owner', 'Country.of.Origin']
```

instead we can use 2 sets col square brackets if we do not want a separate variable

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df[['Owner', 'Country.of.Origin']].head(1)
```



## Subsetting by values

We can do boolean operators on a `pandas.Series` and it will do it automatically to every element
```{code-cell} ipython3
is_green = coffee_df['Color'] == 'Green'
is_green
```

then we can look at the shape and see that it is the same shape as the column we selected. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
is_green.shape, coffee_df['Color'].shape
```

now we can use that to subset the rows

```{code-cell} ipython3
green_coffee_df = coffee_df[is_green]
green_coffee_df.head()
```

and look at the shape to see
```{code-cell} ipython3
green_coffee_df.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
is_green.sum()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.columns
```

## Python has no switch

we use dictionaries in those kind of cases

```{code-cell} ipython3
score_text = {False:'low',
    True:'high'}
```

Here we can switch from a list of true/false to high low

this gives true/false values for if the flavor is above or below 7
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Flavor']>=7
```

and this is high/low instead
```{code-cell} ipython3
[score_text[flavor_comp] for flavor_comp in coffee_df['Flavor']>=7]
```


## Keeping a clean notebook

we can put code in a python file and include it in our notebooks to use it

this can be useful if:
- you have a long hard to read thing that distracts from your other analysis
- you have a function you want to reuse a lot
- (unlikely in class) you need to make your own library!

I created a separate file calledn `example.py` and defined a variable in it like:
```
name ='sarah'
```

now I can import that and use it. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
from example import name
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
name
```

## Additional hints

- pandas objects have `dtype` [info](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dtypes.html)
- using any pandas method is okay, including some we have not seen if it is a single method, for example the `select_dtypes` method [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.select_dtypes.html)
- Your task is partially to learn other IO methods, so the [pandas docs IO page](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html) is a good resource

## Questions After Class

```{important}
some questions are not answered below because they are explained in the notes above or they are too vague, you can come to office hours if you have a question that is not here or post a more detailed question on this repo or your assignment
```

### what is pandas? 

it is a Python library. Read more at the [user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)

### My question is how is the data frame being accessed from the url and how can I understand it more clearly?

`pd.read_` functions can do web requests and read data online and load it directly into memory.  To understand in greater detail, I recommend the [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#pandas.read_csv) and then follow through the links through there to the level of depth that you want.

### what does the shape of a dataframe do?

It is just information that we can do

### Why do we need dictionaries to create new rows in the dataframes rather than operators?

We did not use the dictionary to create new rows, we used it to map values to other values.  We will see this patther throughout the course. 


### how to figure out which dataframes from html are useful

we have to look at them. 

### How to download datasets

For your assignment, you can load directly with a URL 


### Is the sum() method only counting true values, and if so, is it simply treating them as 1?

It is adding the values after casting them to integers. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
int(True), int(False)
```


### Why does the thing that happens right before a for in loop apply to all of the values? I think I know but just to be sure

in a list comprehension the part before the for is like the loop body, see above where I defined `a_long` and compare it to the defintion of `a` 



### I would like to learn more about dictionaries

I recommend starting in the python language docs section on [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)  they are a very powerful structure and the text there is technical, but there are plenty of links.  It is really good practice to get good at parsing through technical docs like this.
