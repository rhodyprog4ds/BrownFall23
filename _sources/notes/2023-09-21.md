# Visualization


````{warning}
If your plots do not show, include this in any cell. The `%` signals that this is an 
ipython [magic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html). This one controls [matplotlib](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-matplotlib). Jupyter uses the [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/about/history.html) python kernel. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
%matplotlib inline
```
`````


```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
```


## Summarizing Review
We will start with the same dataset we hvae been working with

```{code-cell} ipython3
robusta_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/robusta_data_cleaned.csv'
robusta_df = pd.read_csv(robusta_data_url,index_col=0)
robusta_df.head(1)
```



Is the robust coffee's `Mouthfeel` or the `Aftertaste` more consistently scored in this dataset?


Why?
```{code-cell} ipython3
cols_to_compare = ['Mouthfeel', 'Aftertaste']
robusta_df[cols_to_compare].std()
```

from the lower `std` we can see that Aftertaste is more consistently rated.


We will use a larger dataset for more interesting plots. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
arabica_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/arabica_data_cleaned.csv'
coffee_df = pd.read_csv(arabica_data_url,index_col=0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.head(1)
```

Recall, we can us built in plots in pandas. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Aftertaste'].plot(kind='hist')
```

## Plotting in Python

- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): low level plotting tools
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html): high level plotting with opinionated defaults
- [ggplot](https://yhat.github.io/ggpy/): plotting based on the ggplot library in R.


Pandas and seaborn use matplotlib under the hood.

````{margin}
```{admonition}  Think Ahead
Learning ggplot is a way to earn level 3 for visualize
```
````
Seaborn and ggplot both assume the data is set up as a DataFrame.
Getting started with seaborn is the simplest, so we'll use that.


There are lots of type of plots, we saw the basic patterns of how to use them and we've used a few types, but we cannot (and do not need to) go through every single type.  There are general patterns that you can use that will help you think about what type of plot you might want and help you understand them to be able to customize plots.  

[Seaborn's main goal is opinionated defaults and flexible customization](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html#opinionated-defaults-and-flexible-customization

### Anatomy of a figure

First is the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) structure of a figure.  BOth pandas and seaborn and other plotting libraries use matplotlib. Matplotlib was used [in visualizing the first Black hole](https://numfocus.org/case-studies/first-photograph-black-hole).

![annotated graph](https://matplotlib.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_anatomy_001.png)

This is a lot of information, but these are good to know things.  THe most important is the figure and the axes.

```{admonition} Try it Yourself
Make sure you can explain what is a figure and what are axes in your own words and why that distinction matters. Discuss in office hours if you are unsure.
```

*that image was [drawn with code](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/showcase/anatomy.html#anatomy-of-a-figure)* and that page explains more.


### Plotting Function types in Seaborn

Seaborn has two *levels* or groups of plotting functions. Figure and axes.  Figure level fucntions can plot with subplots.

![summary of plot types](https://seaborn.pydata.org/_images/function_overview_8_0.png)


This is from thie [overivew]() section of the official seaborn tutorial. It also includes a comparison of
[figure vs axes](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/function_overview.html#relative-merits-of-figure-level-functions) plotting.

The [official introduction](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html) is also a good read.

### More

The [seaborn gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) and [matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/gallery.html) are nice to look at too.

### Styling in Seaborn

```{important}
This was not covered in class, but can be helpful
```

Seaborn also lets us set a theme for visual styling 
This by default styles the plots to be more visually appealing

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.set_theme(palette='colorblind')
```

the colorblind palette is more distinguishable under a variety fo colorblindness types. [for more](https://gist.github.com/mwaskom/b35f6ebc2d4b340b4f64a4e28e778486). 
Colorblind is a good default, but you can choose others that you like more too.

[more on colors](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html#general-principles-for-using-color-in-plots)



```{code-cell} ipython3
robusta_df.columns
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.columns
```

```{important}
For `seaborn` the online documentation is **immensely** valuable.  Every function's page has basic documentation and lots of examples, so you can see how they use different paramters to modify plots visually. I **strongly recommend reading it often**. I recommend reading [their tutorial too](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html)
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data = coffee_df, x='Flavor')
```

Note explain the layout warning

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data = coffee_df, x='Aftertaste',)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.scatterplot(data=coffee_df, x='Flavor', y='Balance')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.relplot(data=coffee_df, x='Flavor', y='Balance',)
```

Plotting functions return an object that you can use to customize the plots further. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
g = sns.relplot(data=coffee_df, x='Flavor', y='Balance',
           hue='Country.of.Origin',)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(g)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
g. # tab can show the options for attributes andmethods on this object
```

## Bags per country

How many bags of coffee are produced per country?


```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.catplot(data=coffee_df, x='Country.of.Origin',y='Number.of.Bags',
           kind='count');
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.groupby('Country.of.Origin')['Number.of.Bags'].sum()
```

![split-apply-combine](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/figures/03.08-split-apply-combine.png)

```{code-cell} ipython3
country_grouped = coffee_df.groupby('Country.of.Origin')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
country_grouped
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
bag_total_dict = {}

for country,df in country_grouped:
    tot_bags =  df['Number.of.Bags'].sum()
    bag_total_dict[country] = tot_bags

pd.DataFrame.from_dict(bag_total_dict, orient='index',
                           columns = ['Number.of.Bags.Sum'])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
'a b'.split(' ')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a,b = 'a b'.split(' ')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
b
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
bags_per_country_df = coffee_df.groupby('Country.of.Origin')['Number.of.Bags'].sum()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
bags_per_country_df.plot(kind='bar')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.columns
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
flavor_by_color = coffee_df.groupby('Color')['Flavor']
flavor_by_color.mean()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
flavor_by_color.std()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data=coffee_df, x='Flavor',col='Color' )
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data=coffee_df, x='Flavor',hue='Color' ,kind='kde')
```


## Filtering a DataFrame
Now, we'll take just the country names out

How does color vary by country of origin for the top 10 countries with the most ratings?


```{code-cell} ipython3
df_country = coffee_df['Country.of.Origin'].value_counts()
top_countries = df_country[:10].index
top_countries
```


### Filtering with a lambda and the `apply` method?

```{code-cell} ipython3
check_top_country = lambda r: r['Country.of.Origin'] in top_countries
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
'Mexico' in top_countries
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
'USA' in top_countries
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
top_country_df = coffee_df[coffee_df.apply(check_top_country,axis=1)]
```


### Filtering with `isin`


and we can use that to filter the original `DataFrame`. To do this, we use [`isin`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.isin.html#pandas.Series.isin) to check each element in the `'Country.of.Origin'` column is in that list. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Country.of.Origin'].isin(top_countries)
```

This is roughly equivalent to: 
```{code-cell} ipython3
[country in top_countries for country in coffee_df['Country.of.Origin'] ]
```
except this builds a list and the pandas way makes a `pd.Series` object. The Python [`in` operator](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in) is really helpful to know and pandas offers us an `isin` method to get that type of pattern. 

In a more basic programming format this process would be two separate loops worth of work. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
c_in = []
# iterate over the country of each rating
for country in coffee_df['Country.of.Origin']:
    # make a false temp value
    cur_search = False
    # iterate over top countries
    for tc in top_countries:
        # flip the value if the current top & rating cofee match
        if tc==country:
            cur_search = True
    # save the result of the search
    c_in.append(cur_search)
```

```{admonition} Try it yourself
Run these versions and confirm for yourself that they are the same. 
```


With that list of booleans, we can then [mask the original DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing). This keeps only the value where the inner quantity is `True`

```{code-cell} ipython3
top_coffee_df = coffee_df[coffee_df['Country.of.Origin'].isin(top_countries)]
top_coffee_df.head(1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
top_coffee_df.shape, coffee_df.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.displot(data=top_coffee_df,x='Aftertaste', col='Country.of.Origin',col_wrap=5)
```



## Variable types and data types

Related but not the same.


Data types are literal, related to the representation in the computer.

For exmaple,  `int16, int32, int64`



We can also have mathematical types of numbers

- Integers can be positive, 0, or negative.
- Reals are continuous, infinite possibilities.



Variable types are about the meaning in a conceptual sense.

- **categorical** (can take a discrete number of values, could be used to group data,
  could be a string or integer; unordered)
- **continuous** (can take on any possible value, always a number)
- **binary** (like data type boolean, but could be represented as yes/no, true/false,
  or 1/0, could be categorical also, but often makes sense to calculate rates)
- **ordinal** (ordered, but appropriately categorical)

we'll focus on the first two most of the time. Some values that are technically
only integers range high enough that we treat them more like continuous most of
the time.


## Questions After Class

### how can I use data to make different graphs?

You can use the help function on any of the plot functions we have seen. You can also use the documentation.  

The [seaborn gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) is a good place to get ideas


### Will we learn about different types of graphs?

We will use a few more types in class, but also you will probably use the documentation to learn more types. 
The [seaborn gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) is a good place to start. 

### What are the advantages with work with the lambda function?

The `lambda` function is convenient because it is defined on one line. 

### Is a lambda function similar to an arrow function in Javascript?

It does look similar, but I am not an expert in javascipt. 


### How do you decide on the best graphs to use for each piece of data?

Different types of plots make different conclusions easy to see. 

### why do you use axis = 1 for the check_top_countries

### could you do group by instead of value counts for the last question?
yes

### more about different ways to plot data and how to get specific rows and compare them

### is there a document that shows us all the diffrent commands that allow us to do things to files
