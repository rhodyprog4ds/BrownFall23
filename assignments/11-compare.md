## Instructions




```{tip}
this is best for regression or classification, but if you use clustering
use the `scoring` parameter to pass better metrics than the default
of the score method.
```

```{hint}
See the questions to consider in A10 for more detail on what to consider when optimizing each model. 

If you are skipping submitting A10, follow those instructions for each model. 
```

Choose a dataset, it can be appropriate for classification, regression, or clustering. Optimize at least two models for the same task and choose the appropriate metrics to compare the fit. Decide which model you would recommend based on a realistic setting for that dataset and include evidence justifying that choice. Summarize your findings with plots and tables as appropriate.

You can reuse a dataset you've used for one of the previous assignments or choose a new dataset.

```{admonition} Think Ahead

How would this decision making compare for a more complex model or in more realistic setting.

```
